this an arduino-based robotic arm project, A 4 joints Arm installed on a rotating base, which are all installed ON a controlled small car with three wheels, Both -the car and the arm- are controlled by ONE PS2 controller.

the arm intially has a medical-based purpose, maybe more advanced ones will be insidde the operations room with the surgeons, put for now this will do.

the car's purpose isn't just a show-off, but to give the arm more moving freedom........duuuhh.

you need to download the <PS2X\_lib.h> library to be able to compile the project's code. 



Future updates may include a Computer Vision ML model that would drive the car and arm to shoot water or catch or even hit certain targets.







this Project's main objective is to provide US THE LEARNERS with an introduction to the usage of AVR-MicroControllers, Robotic Motors and Mechanics, Arduino code, PS2 controller, and other Concepts that were made easier to understand by playing around with them.

Many thanks to @hshokry for making such a beautiful and meaningful project possible,You're really an Inspiration and a Guide, Thanks is the least I can say.

thanks also to my colleague AHMED HAMADA who doesn't have a github account yet.
thanks to my Professor the Head of Electrical Engineering Department at my college prof/ AL-TAIB ABDEEN IBRAHEM.
