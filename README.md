# DISPLACABLE MEDICAL-BASED ROBOTIC ARM WITH SPRAY
## Made with good intentions :gift_heart:

This is an Arduino-based robotic arm project, A 4 joints Arm installed on a rotating base (Total 5 joints), With three wheels attached to the base, Two rear dc-motors wheels, And a third un-controlled 360° wheel in the front, Both -the car and the arm- are controlled by ONE PlayStation2 controller, used Components: this project in Total uses 8 DC-Motors, 2 Arduino UNOs, 4 L298N H-bridge Motor Driver Modules, a Spray bottle (most likely for Medical Alcohol), 3 Wheels, 7 Li-ion chargable batteries 4-Volts each, a lot of Code, and a lot of effort.

The arm intially has a **Medical-based** purpose, maybe more advanced ones will be inside the operations room with the surgeons, but for now this maybe beneficial for **remote treaments** and **Remote Medical examination and diagnosis**, such as **Covid-19 Patients**.

the car's purpose isn't just a show-off, but to give the arm more moving freedom.

You need to download the following libraries: <PS2X\_lib.h> , <AFMotor.h> , <SoftwareSerial.h> , to be able to compile and use the project's code.

**FEEL FREE to use, copy, fork & pull, or learn** from this project's code. it's 100% for the open source.


Future updates may include a Computer Vision ML model that can automatically drive the car and the arm to spray a liquid or catch or even hit certain targets. Feel free also to **Fork and PR**Your edits and Updates, I WILL be responding.

Motor Drivers, Robotic Motors and Mechanics, Arduino C++ Code, PS2 controllers, UART Protocol.

الحمدلله
Thanks to my colleague AHMED HAMADA who doesn't have a github account yet (LOL), So I had to commit his updates on the code with my account. we worked fully together on this even though we didn't continue it but that for reasons greater than both of us.
Many Thanks also to @hshokry for making such a beautiful and meaningful project possible, You're really an Inspiration and a Guide, Thanks is just the least I can say.
