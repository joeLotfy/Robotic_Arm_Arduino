# DISPLACABLE ROBOTIC ARM WITH SPRAY
## Made with good intentions :gift_heart:

This an arduino-based robotic arm project, A 4 joints Arm installed on a rotating base (total 5 joints), With three wheels attached to the base, Two rear dc-motors weels, And a third un-controlled 360° wheel, Both -the car and the arm- are controlled by ONE PS2 controller, used Components: this project in total uses 8 dc-motors, 2 Arduino UNO, 4 L298N H-bridge Motor Driver Module, a Spray bottle, 3 Wheels, 7 Li-ion chargable batteries 4Volts each, a lot of Code, and a lot of effort.

The arm intially has a **Medical-based** purpose, maybe more advanced ones will be inside the operations room with the surgeons, but for now this maybe beneficial for **remote treaments** and **Remote Medical examination and diagnosis**, such as **Covid-19 Patients**

the car's purpose isn't just a show-off, but to give the arm more moving freedom.

You need to download the <PS2X\_lib.h> library and the <AFMotor.h> library and the <SoftwareSerial.h> library, to be able to compile and use the project's code.

**Feel free to use or learn** from this project's code.


Future updates may include a Computer Vision ML model that can automatically drive the car and the arm to spray a liquid or catch or even hit certain targets. Feel free also to **Fork and PR** Your edits and Updates.

Motor Drivers, Robotic Motors and Mechanics, Arduino C++ Code, PS2 controllers, UART Protocol.

الحمدلله

Many Thanks to @hshokry for making such a beautiful and meaningful project possible, You're really an Inspiration and a Guide, Thanks is just the least I can say.

Thanks also to my colleague AHMED HAMADA who doesn't have a github account yet (LOL), So I had to commit his updates on the code with my account.
